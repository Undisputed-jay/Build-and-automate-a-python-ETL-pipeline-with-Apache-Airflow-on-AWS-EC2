# Build and Automate an ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow on AWS EC2

In this data engineering project, i will build and automate an ETL process that can extract current weather data from open weather map API, transform the data into an AWS S3 bucket and load it to a data warehouse(AWS Redshift) using Apache Airflow. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for orchestrating and scheduling workflows of tasks and data pipelines. This project will be entirely carried out on AWS cloud platform.
